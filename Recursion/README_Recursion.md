# Recursion

**Recursion**

- It is a way of solving problems by having a function calling itself. In other words, it solves a smaller subset of the problem. This goes on till an exit condition is reached.
- - If no base condition (exit condition) is provided, it will continue calling itself without ending resulting in an infinite loop which eventually results to Stack overflow error.

*When should we choose Recursion?*

- If we can divide the problem into smaller sub-problems
- Algorithm to compute nth ...
- Write code to list the n ...
- Implement a method to compute all.

- It is also  used in data structures such as trees and graphs.
- It is used in many algorithms (such as divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic programming).
