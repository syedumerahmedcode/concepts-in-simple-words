# Recursion

**Recursion**

- It is a way of solving problems by having a function calling itself. In other words, it solves a smaller subset of the problem. This goes on till an exit condition is reached.
- - If no base condition (exit condition) is provided, it will continue calling itself without ending resulting in an infinite loop which eventually results to Stack overflow error.
