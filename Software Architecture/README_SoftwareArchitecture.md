# Software Architecture


**Definitions of Software Architecture**

There are various (correct) definitions of software architecture.

- *ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 definition of “architecture”*: Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution.
- *IEEE 1471 definition of “software architecture”*: The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each
other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.
- *SEI / [Bass+2012] definition of “software architecture”*: The software architecture of a system is a set of structures needed to reason about the system which comprise software elements, relations among them and the properties of both.     

What do some of the terms mean:

- _Component_: Building block of system.
- _Structure_: A collection of related elements that do a common task together.
- _Relationships/dependencies_: The coupling of elements allowing them to cooperate or exchange data.
- _Architecture decision_: A decision that helps in the evolution of an architecture.
- _Cross-cutting concerns_: Rules valid at several locations or points throughout the system and its development.
- _Decomposition of larger things into smaller things_: If a problem is too large to handle all at once, break it down into more manageable units.
